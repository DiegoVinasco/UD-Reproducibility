 * [Artifact Eval](https://www.artifact-eval.org/about.html): the process section
   states that __To maintain a wall of separation between paper review and the
   artifacts, authors will only be asked to upload their artifacts after their
   papers have been accepted__.
 * [GRSI (Graphics Repricability Stamp Initiative)](http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/):
   "Application process" section states that __Any paper accepted in or after 2017 at
   one the following journals is eligible to apply for the stamp__.
