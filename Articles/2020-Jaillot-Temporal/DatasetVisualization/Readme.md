## Visualization of 3D Tiles and 3D Tiles temporal datasets

We compared the performances in terms of visualization and of spatial and
temporal navigation of a dataset in 3D Tiles (*DS-3DTiles*) and of a dataset in
3D Tiles with temporal extension (*DS-3DTiles-Tmp*).

These datasets are described, links for downloading them are given and
instructions for computing them again are provided on another page of this
repository at the following links:
[DS-3DTiles](../DatasetComparison/Readme.md#DS-3DTiles) and
[DS-3DTiles-Tmp](../DatasetComparison/Readme.md#DS-3DTiles-Tmp).

In this folder, we present two results and instructions to reproduce them:
  * [Time for loading and rendering DS-3DTiles and DS-3DTiles-Tmp](LoadingAndRendering.md)
  * [Animation time comparisons](AnimationTime.md)
